pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
import geordie

# Example texts
texts = [
    "I visited Paris last summer.",
    "Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world."
]

# Process the texts
results = geordie.process_texts(texts)

for text_result in results:
    for entity_info in text_result:
        print(f"Entity: {entity_info['entity']}")
        print(f"Wikidata Info: {entity_info['wikidata_info']}")
        print(f"Classification: {entity_info['classification']}")
        print(f"Sentence: {entity_info['sentence']}\n")
```
